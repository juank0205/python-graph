# python-graph
## About
This project implements a graphical interface for graphing mathematical functions or differential equations.<br>
The input of any mathematical expression **must be done in python syntax**.<br>
<br>
This **doesn't** work<br>
> 3x+4
This works
> 3\*x+4
### Mathematical expressions
You can use mathematical expressions included in numpy and the math library, such as sin() or cos(), just express them as np.sin() for example. <br>
This also works
> 2\*np.sin(x)\*\*2-3
